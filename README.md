# C-2
Welcome to my game!

First, it will ask weather you want to play the game or not; if yes, it will print out "Okay, let's go", whereas if no, it will print out "Alright, bye!" and terminate the program.

If continued, it will ask questions like...

Is Python a creature or a programming language?
What is a double in Java, C#, C and C++?
What is HTML used for?
and more :)
